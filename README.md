# Horiseon Code Refactor Challenge 1

The goal of this challenge was to refactor a preexisting page primarily focused on accessibility.

These were the criteria

Acceptance Criteria
GIVEN a webpage meets accessibility standards
WHEN I view the source code
THEN I find semantic HTML elements
WHEN I view the structure of the HTML elements
THEN I find that the elements follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning
WHEN I view the image elements
THEN I find accessible alt attributes
WHEN I view the heading attributes
THEN they fall in sequential order
WHEN I view the title element
THEN I find a concise, descriptive title

I believe this has been accomplished as, much of the css has been merged or moved, the html no long has generic divs, all the images have alt text, and the integrity of the site has been retained.
